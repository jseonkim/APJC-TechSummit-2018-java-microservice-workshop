# Overview of This Workshop

- This workshop introduce the fundamental concenpt and steps for the migration from Java Monolithic application to microservices on AWS environment.
- The simple platform or code changing is not able to fullfill the requirement of migration to the microservies


## Basic Steps of Migration
1. Identify Domains and data (Domain Decomposition)
2. Migrate database (Splitting data/ database refactoring)    
3. Select best platform for microservices  
4. Change your application

## Practical Steps for Java application migration
1. Create a HTTP endpoints
2. Externalize Configuration
3. Expose Application Metrics and Information
4. Calling Another Service
5. Deploy Microservices at Scale with Docker and ECS/EKS
6. Cluster Management  
Service Discovery  
Failure Mangement : Cluster self healing  
Circuit Breaker pattern  
Load Balancing
7. Logging, Tracing, Metric Monitoring, CI/CD, Configuraiton management
